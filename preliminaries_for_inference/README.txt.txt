Here I try to wrap up the code of the simulator (samples from the canonical distribution of the model with fixed values of the parameters) also has the multiple markov chains implemented and put everything inside library in a well organised fashion. In this way once I want to perform the likelihood-free inference where I need to run short simulations I need only a line of code. To this I need to put all the parameters inside a input text file. The parameters needed to pass to input are the hamiltonian parameters i.e. fields (computed from regression weights), coupling ecc...the parameters for the MMC and need also to initialize the spins and the polymer conformation from input. The idea if that first of all equilibrating is expensive, then once I equilibrated for a give set of parameters if the monte carlo step we make in the parameters space is small the final conformation we get in the previous step is roughly equilibated also for the new set of parameters.
